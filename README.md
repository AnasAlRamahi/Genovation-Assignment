# DashboardAssignment

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.0.3.

## Running the project

To start a local development server, you should have these installed on your machine:
  - Git (and git bash in case you are using windows)
  - Node (with npm or yarn)
  - Angular CLI

Now you should be able to get the project and run it. Use GitBash in the folder you want the project to be in and then do this sequence of commands in order:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnasAlRamahi/Genovation-Assignment.git

cd Genovation-Assignment/

npm install

ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Assumptions

Going thorugh the assignment, I assumed that:
- I had to use Primeng components to implement the design.
- The 2 cards that don't appear in the dashboard on desktop window size are hidden unless on mobile size.
- I assumed that the icon in the last column of the table is to add new column, and we can adjust their values if we click on the pen icon of any row.
