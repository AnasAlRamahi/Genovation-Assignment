# DashboardAssignment

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.0.3.

## Development server

To start a local development server, you should have these installed on your machine:
  - Git (and git bash in case you are using windows)
  - Node (with npm or yarn)
  - Angular CLI

Now you should be able to get the project and run it. Use GitBash in the folder you want the project to be in and then do this sequence of commands in order:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Assumptions going through the assignment

Going thorugh the assignment, I assumed that:
- I had to use Primeng components to implement the design.
- The 2 cards that don't appear in the dashboard on desktop window size are hidden unless on mobile size.
